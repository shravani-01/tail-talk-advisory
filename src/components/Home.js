        <h2><b>Motivation for Our Project</b></h2>
        <p>
        Our motivation for creating this chatbot for pet parents and young veterinary professionals stems from our own experiences as pet owners. We understand the desire to seek quick answers to small behavioral queries without necessarily wanting to incur the expense of consulting a professional for every little concern. As pet lovers ourselves, we often find ourselves turning to Google for guidance, but we recognize the limitations and uncertainties associated with online information. Therefore, we aim to provide a convenient and accessible platform where individuals can seek advice and information regarding their pets' behavior and well-being.           </p>
        <p>
        However, it's important to note that while our chatbot can offer insights and suggestions based on common knowledge and experiences, we do not claim to be medical professionals. We strongly advise pet owners to seek a second opinion from a qualified veterinary professional for any concerns regarding their pets' health or behavior. Our ultimate goal is to empower pet parents and young veterinary professionals with reliable resources while prioritizing the well-being and safety of our beloved animal companions.          </p>
